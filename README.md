Simciv
---------

An attempt to create an online world and city simulation game, inspired on Dwarf Fortress, Pharaoh, Age of Empires and Simcity.
It is in 2D and is based on really simplistic bricks (grid-based), but will support very big worlds.
Note: I previously made a local-only prototype in Java of the same name. This C++ one might be called a two.
I don't know yet if I'll support development for long. I made this because I like Pharaoh and Dwarf Fortress, and wanted to experiment more with the Enet networking library.
